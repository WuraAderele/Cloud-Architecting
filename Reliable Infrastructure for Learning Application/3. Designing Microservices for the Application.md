# Designing Microservices for the Application

We opt for a microservice architecture for the proposed application because of the below benefits:
* Ability to scale individual services to according to individual load in order to optimize use of infrastructure
* Ability to use the best suied languages and frameworks for the different services
* Ability to choose the runtime appropriate for each service
* To enable faster innovation and easier addition of new features in the future

## Microservices for the NWA Teacher Learning Platform
**User Management Service** - Handles user account creation and authentication

**Subscription Service** - Checks if a user has an active subscription when they attempt to access content

**Content Management Service** - Provides video and learning content to subscribed learners

**Engagement Service** - Tracks learning activities and updates the "For You" page based on user interactions

**Analytics Service** -  focuses on collecting, processing, and storing raw data related to user interactions, and content performance

**Reporting Service** - generates and delivers various reports based on the analytics data for teachers and business owners

**E-commerce Service** - manages the shopping experience, from browsing artifacts to managing the shopping cart

**Payment Service** - processes transactions securely when buyers proceed to checkout

**Notification Service** - sends out various notifications to users as needed

## Storage Considerations for Microservices
In line with  best practices, each microservice will have its own storage or database to further ensure that there are no underlying dependencies between the various services. We .achieve a clean separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. We have outlined the below data storage needs:

**User Accounts** - storage for user profiles and preferences

**Subscription** - storage to manage subscription plans and user subscriptions

**Content Database** - storage for educational content and metadata

**Enagement** - storage for tracking user activities and engagement metrics

**Analytics** - storage for aggregating data from other services

**E-commerce** - storage for managing product listinfs, shops, order history

**Shopping cart** - storage for shopping cart data for buyers

**Payments** - storage for transaction details and payment status

**Notifications** - storage fpr keeping track of notification logs and delivery statuses

We delve more into the storage characteristics based on the type of data, scale, durability, and availablity to be able determine the specific storage services to recommend for each. You can see more here or simply follow the case study solutions in order to eventually arrive at this information
