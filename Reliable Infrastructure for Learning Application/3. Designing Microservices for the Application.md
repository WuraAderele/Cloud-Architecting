# Designing Microservices for the Application

We opt for a microservice architecture for the proposed application because of the below benefits:
* Ability to scale individual services according to individual load in order to optimize use of infrastructure
* Ability to use the best suited languages and frameworks for the different services
* Ability to choose the runtime appropriate for each service
* To enable faster innovation and easier addition of new features in the future

## Storage Needs for Microservices
In line with  best practices, each microservice will have its own storage or database to further ensure that there are no underlying dependencies between the various services. We achieve a clean separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. We have outlined the below data storage needs:

**User Accounts** - storage for user profiles and preferences

**Subscription** - storage to manage subscription plans and user subscriptions

**Content Database** - storage for educational content and metadata

**Enagement** - storage for tracking user activities and engagement metrics

**Analytics** - storage for aggregating data from other services

**E-commerce** - storage for managing product listings, shops, order history

**Shopping cart** - storage for shopping cart data for buyers

**Payments** - storage for transaction details and payment status

**Notifications** - storage for keeping track of notification logs and delivery statuses

**Community Service** - storage for posts, discussions, questions, and answers

We delve more into the storage characteristics based on the type of data, scale, durability, and availablity to be able determine the specific storage services to recommend for each. You can see more here or simply follow the case study solutions in order to eventually arrive at this information
