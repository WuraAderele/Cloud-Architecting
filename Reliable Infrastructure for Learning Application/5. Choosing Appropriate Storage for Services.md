# Storage Considerations for Microservices

**User Accounts** - storage for user data and profiles - these kinds of data require strong consistency to ensure user details like passwords are always up to date

**Subscription** - storage to manage subscription plans and user subscriptions - requires strong consistency to ensure accurate subscription statuses and plans

**Content** - storage for educational content and metadata - unstructured video and text content that will benefit from the flexibility of NoSQL database

**Enagement** - storage for tracking user activities and engagement metrics - will require eventual consistency to be able to make accurate recommendations

**Analytics** - storage for aggregating data from other services - slight delays in analytics are acceptable so eventual consistency suffices

**Reporting** - storage for templates to be used by analytics service and reports generated

**E-commerce** - storage for managing product listings, shops, order history - requires strong consistency for accurate e-commerce operations

**Shopping cart** - storage for shopping cart data for buyers

**Payments** - storage for transaction details and payment status  - requires strong consistency to ensure transaction integrity

**Notifications** - storage for keeping track of notification logs and delivery statuses

**Community Service** - storage for posts, discussions, questions, and answers
