# Designing REST APIs for Communication between Defined Microservices

The various services that we have outlined here interact to provide the full functionality of 
the NWA Teacher application.

Each service exposes a set of RESTful APIs that other services can call using text-based payloads. These APIs use HTTPS for secure communication, ensuring that data exchanged between services is encrypted and secure.

Collections refer to the main resources or entities to be managed by each service

Methods refers to HTTP request methods that indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resources. 

| Service | Collections | Methods | Operations | API Endpoint |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| User Management Service | users | POST, PATCH, GET, PUT, DELETE |  Create User, Get User Details, Update User, Delete User | /api/v1/users |
| Subscription Service | subscriptions | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE | Subscribe, Get Subscription Details, Update Subscription, Cancel Subscription | /api/v1/subscriptions |
| Content Management Service | content | POST, PATCH, GET, PUT, DELETE | Upload Content, Get Content, Update Content, Delete Content | /api/v1/content |
| Engagement Service | activities | POST, GET | Track activity | /api/v1/engagement |
| | engagement metrics | GET | Get engagement metrics | /api/v1/engagement |
| Analytics Service | analytics data | POST, GET | Collect Data, Get Analytics Data | /api/v1/analytics |
| Reporting Service | reports | PUT, POST, GET | Generate Report, Get Report | /api/v1/reports| 
| | templates | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE | |  |
| E-commerce Service | shops | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE |  | /api/v1/ecommerce |
| | products | POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE | List Products, Get Product Details, Update Product, Delete Product |
| | orders | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE | | |
| | carts | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE | | |
| Payment Service | payments | POST, GET | Process Payment, Get Payment Status | /api/v1/payments |
| | transactions | POST, GET | | |
| Notification Service | notifications | POST, GET | Send Notification, Get Notification Status | /api/v1/notifications |
| | messages | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE | | |

**HTTP Methods Defined:**
* GET - Retrieve a single item or a list of items
* PUT - Update an item
* POST - Create an item
* DELETE - Delete an item
* PATCH - Partially modify an item

Each service carries out specific actions that map to these standard HTTP Methods. For instance, the Analytics service collects data from other services using the GET Method or the Subscription service can update a user's subscription using the PUT Method.

**Example Communication Flow:**
* A learner creates an account via the User Management Service
* The learner subscribes to a course via the Subscription Service
* The Content Management Service recommends content based on the learner's preferences and activity
* The learner engages with the content, and their activity is tracked by the Engagement Service
* The Analytics Service collects engagement data and provides insights
* The Reporting Service generates periodic reports for teachers on content performance
* A business owner lists cultural artifacts for sale via the E-commerce Service
* A buyer adds items to the shopping cart and proceeds to checkout, interacting with the E-commerce Service and Payment Service
* Notifications about subscription renewals, new content, and purchase confirmations are sent by the Notification Service

**Security Considerations for Accessing APIs**
* Using HTTPS for all API communications to ensure data is encryped in transit
* Implementing token based authorization to secure APIs. Each service should validate tokens to ensure requests are authenticated and authorized
* Applying rate limiting to APIs to prevent abuse and ensure service stability
* Validating all incoming requests to prevent injection attacks and ensuring data integrity
