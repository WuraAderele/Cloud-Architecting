# Designing REST APIs for Communication between Defined Microservices

The various services that we have outlined here interact to provide the full functionality of 
the NWA Teacher application.

Each service exposes a set of RESTful APIs that other services can call using text-based payloads. These APIs use HTTPS for secure communication, ensuring that data exchanged between services is encrypted and secure.

Collections refer to the main resources or entities to be managed by each service

Methods refers to HTTP request methods that indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resources. 

| Service | Collections | Methods | Operations | API Endpoint |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| User Management Service | users | POST, PATCH, GET, PUT, DELETE |  Create User, Get User Details, Update User, Delete User | /api/v1/users |
| Subscription Service | subscriptions | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE | Subscribe, Get Subscription Details, Update Subscription, Cancel Subscription | /api/v1/subscriptions |
| Content Management Service | content | POST, PATCH, GET, PUT, DELETE | Upload Content, Get Content, Update Content, Delete Content | /api/v1/content |
| Engagement Service | activities | POST, GET | Track activity | /api/v1/engagement |
| | engagement metrics | GET | Get engagement metrics | /api/v1/engagement |
| Analytics Service | analytics data | POST, GET | Collect Data, Get Analytics Data | /api/v1/analytics |
| Reporting Service | reports | PUT, POST, GET | Generate Report, Get Report | /api/v1/reports| 
| | templates | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE | |  |
| E-commerce Service | shops | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE |  | /api/v1/ecommerce |
| | products | POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE | List Products, Get Product Details, Update Product, Delete Product |

| | carts | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE | | |
| Payment Service | payments | POST, GET | Process Payment, Get Payment Status | /api/v1/payments |
| | transactions | POST, GET | | |

HTTP Methods Defined:
* GET - Retrieve a single item or a list of items
* PUT - Update an item
* POST - Create an item
* DELETE - Delete an item
* PATCH - Partially modify an item

Each service carries out specific actions that map to these standard HTTP Methods. For instance, the Analytics service collects data from other services using the GET Method or the Subscription service can update a user's subscription using the PUT Method.
