# Designing REST APIs for Communication between Microservices

The various services that we have outlined here interact to provide the full functionality of 
the NWA Teacher application.

Each service exposes a set of RESTful APIs that other services can call using text-based payloads. These APIs use HTTPS for secure
communication, ensuring that data exchanged between services is encrypted and secure.
