# Designing REST APIs for Communication between Defined Microservices

The various services that we have outlined here interact to provide the full functionality of 
the NWA Teacher application.

Each service exposes a set of RESTful APIs that other services can call using text-based payloads. These APIs use HTTPS for secure communication, ensuring that data exchanged between services is encrypted and secure.

Collections refer to the main resources or entities to be managed by each service

Methods refers to HTTP request methids that indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resources
