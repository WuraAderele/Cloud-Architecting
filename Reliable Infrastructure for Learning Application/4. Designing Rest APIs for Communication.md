# Designing REST APIs for Communication between Defined Microservices

The various services that we have outlined here interact to provide the full functionality of 
the NWA Teacher application.

Each service exposes a set of RESTful APIs that other services can call using text-based payloads. These APIs use HTTPS for secure communication, ensuring that data exchanged between services is encrypted and secure.

Collections refer to the main resources or entities to be managed by each service

Methods refers to HTTP request methods that indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resources. 

| Service | Collections | Methods |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------- |
| User Management Service | users | POST, PATCH, GET, PUT, DELETE |
| Subscription Service | subscriptions | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE |
| Content Management Service | content | POST, PATCH, GET, PUT, DELETE |
| Engagement Service | activities | POST, GET |
| | engagement metrics | GET |
| Analytics Service | analytics data | POST, GET |
| Reporting Service | reports | PUT, POST, GET |
| | templates | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE |
| E-commerce Service | shops | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE |
| | shops | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE |
| | products | POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE |
| | orders | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE |
| | carts | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE |
| Payment Service | payments | POST, GET |
| | transactions | POST, GET |
| Notification Service | notifications | POST, GET |
| | messages | POST, GET, PUT, DELETE |

HTTP Methods Defined:
* GET - Retrieve a single item or a list of items
* PUT - Update an item
* POST - Create an item
* DELETE - Delete an item
* PATCH - Partially modify an item

Each service carries out specific actions that map to these standard HTTP Methods. For instance, the Analytics service collects data from other services using the GET Method or the Subscription service can update a user's subscription using the PUT Method.
