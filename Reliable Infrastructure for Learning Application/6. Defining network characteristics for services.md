# Network Characteristics of Services

Next, we want to define the specific network characteristics of each microservice and choose the 
appropriate load balancers for each one.

| Service | Internet facing or Internal only | HTTP | TCP | Multiregional | Multi-zonal | Load Balancer Type |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | ---- | --- | ------------- | ---------- | ---- |
| User Management| Internet facing | Yes | | No | Yes | HTTP(S) Load Balancer |
| Subscription | Internet facing | Yes | | No | Yes | HTTP(S) Load Balancer |
| Content Managament | Internet facing | Yes | | No | Yes | HTTP(S) Load Balancer |
| Engagement | Internal | | Yes | | No | Yes | Proxy Network Load Balancer |
| Analytics | Internal | | Yes | | No | Yes | Proxy Network Load Balancer |
| Reports | Internet facing | Yes | | No | Yes | HTTP(S) Load Balancer |
| E-commerce | Internet facing | Yes | | No | Yes | HTTP(S) Load Balancer |
| Payment | Internet facing | Yes | | No | Yes | HTTP(S) Load Balancer |
| Notification | Internet facing | Yes | | No | Yes | HTTP(S) Load Balancer |
| Community Interaction | Internet facing | Yes | | No | Yes | HTTP(S) Load Balancer |

Because NWA Teacher has a localized user base (users are concentrated in Africa at the moment), a regional infrastructure setup suffices. 

However, to design for resilience and availability, resources will be distributed across different zones within the Africa region.

The traffic type of each service determines the Cloud Load balance to be used. 

As a general rule:
* Choose an Application Load Balancer when you need a flexible feature set for your applications with HTTP(S) traffic.
* Choose a proxy Network Load Balancer to implement TLS offload, TCP proxy, or support for external load balancing to backends in multiple regions.
* Choose a passthrough Network Load Balancer to preserve client source IP addresses, avoid the overhead of proxies, and to support additional protocols like UDP, ESP, and ICMP.
