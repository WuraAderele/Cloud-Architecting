# Cloud Architecting
This repository contains my solutions to cloud architecture case studies and exercises.

## ðŸ“• Table of Contents
### [1. Configuring a Scalable Nginx Web Server Infrastructure](https://github.com/WuraAderele/Cloud-Architecting/blob/main/Mini-Case-Study-1.md)

Deployed a load-balanced setup using instance templates, managed instance groups, HTTP(S) load balancers, and health checks to ensure high availability and reliability in Google Cloud.

### [2. Designing a Reliable Infrastructure for a Learning Application](https://github.com/WuraAderele/Cloud-Architecting/tree/main/Reliable%20Infrastructure%20for%20Learning%20Application)
### [3. Infrastructure Automation with Terraform](https://github.com/WuraAderele/Cloud-Architecting/blob/main/Mini-Case-Study-2.md)

Leveraged Terraform to create, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform, including importing existing instances and implementing remote state management.

### [4. Optimize Costs for Google Kubernetes Engine](https://github.com/WuraAderele/Cloud-Architecting/blob/main/Mini-Case-Study-3.md)

Deployed application to GKE, optimized node pools for cost efficiency, applied a frontend update without downtime, and configured autoscaling to handle traffic surges effectively.

### [5. Cloud-Enabled WordPress Deployment and Infrastructure Automation](https://github.com/WuraAderele/Cloud-Architecting/blob/main/Mini-Case-Study-4.md)

Orchestrated scalable WordPress deployment on GCP with Kubernetes, leveraging VPCs, subnets, and firewall rules for secure, high-performance architecture. Managed Cloud SQL integration and implemented monitoring for performance optimization.

### [6. Build and Deploy a Docker Image to a Kubernetes Cluster](https://github.com/WuraAderele/Cloud-Architecting/blob/main/Mini-Case-Study-5.md)

 Deployed a Go-based web server on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Built and pushed Docker images to Google Container Registry, configured Kubernetes clusters, and exposed services via Load Balancer to handle HTTP traffic, ensuring a reliable and scalable application architecture.
